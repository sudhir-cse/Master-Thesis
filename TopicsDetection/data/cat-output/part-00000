Reasoned announcements headline grabbing statements And differences opinion rancour respect Its differences want speak today months country decide change voting First Past Post Alternative Vote Nick believes campaigning yes vote profoundly believe campaign vote yes real difference opinion dont agree Nick But source tension And coalition breaker Far beliefs voting work share important belief belief democracy voice people heard Once votes cast decision accept result referendum continue work national But country facing hugely important futuredeciding vote today explain clearly completely wrong reform2026 2026why bad politics2026 2026and bad democracy For big problems One lead outcomes unfair Two voting unclear And means political unaccountable Let turn First let myth fair proportional currently This really important Those arguing claim make vote count end safe seats encourage smaller parties2026 2026and final result better reflect people measure simply true wont make vote count The reality make votes count Theres inherent unfairness Supporters unpopular parties end having votes counted number times2026 2026potentially deciding outcome election2026 2026while people popular parties vote Why Because vote mainstream candidate ballot round preferences counted But vote fringe party gets knocked preferences counted words bite cherry dont voters BNP Monster Raving Loony Party votes counted times supporters Conservatives matter Labour Liberal Democrats The idea equal voice equal vote deeply enshrined existing electoral The principle person vote makes democracy fair flies face doesnt make vote count like supporters say will2026 2026and end safe seats course argument MPs having ultrasafe seats create jobsforlife mentality reduce accountability incredibly hardworking But answer election 225 MPs elected fifty percent outright difference places And look Australia nearly half seats considered safe Whats increase chances smaller parties winning seat contrary harm Caroline Lucas countrys Green Party got thirtyone percent vote constituency Its Welsh Scottish Nationalists None current MPs got fifty percent votes constituencies Would parties able hold seats threshold fifty percent The evidence Australia suggests smaller parties obliterated Added proportional think Roy Jenkins chaired Independent Commission Voting System said unacceptable danger 2026 increase reduce disproportionality The evidence shows produced larger Labour landslides 1997 20052026 2026and larger Conservative ones 1980s Lets just look example 1997 Back Conservatives won twentyfive percent seats despite recording thirtyone percent vote Disproportional Yes But punished getting likelihood just percent seats The simple fact exaggerate inherent biases current system2026 2026giving Labour bigger advantage General Elections The truth arguments change campaigners really point does theoretical backing fifty percent voters But flawed The fifty cent threshold applies votes counted number votes cast election For example lets say voter decides mark preference ballot paper end doing Alternative Vote person cast vote eliminated vote discarded doesnt count The ones count votes make final round fifty percent reached majority complete fix Its winner half electorate virtue weird counting crawled finishing line And isnt point This backing actual approval Its passive acceptance mean whos really wanted winning election unliked mean courageous brave believe say things agrees pushed politics2026 2026and boring controversial limping victory mean Parliament second choices wouldnt accept walk life Can imagine giving gold medal finishes Theres brilliant simplicity firstpastthepost You walk polling booth cross someones drop paper ballot box person gets votes wins That goes window Its job tell exactly works thats yes campaign explain But job Ill honest dont think Yes theres superficial simplicity getting people rank candidates order preference 2026and redistributing votes gets fifty percent But lot complicated Heres passage book detailing Alternative Vote works process continues preferences allocated remaining candidates second choices electors firstchoice candidates eliminated candidates eliminated say fourth candidate removed contest electors gave preference gave second fourth preferences candidates eliminated fifth preference allocated remaining candidates didnt And Ive
