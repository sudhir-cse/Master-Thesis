Text: Storms around the world by Sarah Wilmshurst

The stormy weather that affected the UK yesterday has also brought chaos to other parts of Northern Europe. Once the deep depression responsible for the wind and rain had cleared away from Scotland, it moved up across Denmark and southern Sweden and into Estonia.  At least 10 people are known to have died, 1,000 homes were flooded and 330,000 people were left without power as the stormy weather swept across Northern Europe.  Airports in Copenhagen and Malmoe were closed last night, many roads in southern Sweden were closed and the bridge between Malmoe and Copenhagen was temporarily shut as well.
Stormy weather has also moved in across California bringing rain, wind and snow.  200 vehicles got stuck in snow early yesterday morning in the San Bernadino Mountains with snow 3 to 4 feet (about a metre) deep along a 15 mile stretch of road.  The wind associated with this storm knocked out power for thousands of homes and businesses.  Meanwhile, the Ohio River is flooding, affecting people in West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky.
Another storm which is causing concern is actually a cyclone to the Northeast of Australia.  This has been named Kerry and is moving very slowly towards the Queensland coast.  It is expected to bring rain and wind to Queensland in the next few days.
There is also a cyclone near Sri Lanka.  Although this does not have particularly high winds associated with it, it is bringing a large amount of rain which will affect some of those areas struggling after the Tsunami.
