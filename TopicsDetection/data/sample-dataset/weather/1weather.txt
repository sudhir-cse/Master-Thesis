Text: Blizzards adding to the snow problems on Thursday by Victoria Good

The snow continues to cause problems for eastern parts of the UK today. Strong easterly winds are picking up again, thus it is a bitingly cold day for the northeast of England especially. Top temperatures today are unlikely to exceed 2 or 3 Celsius for many areas.
Once again, it�s best in the west if you�re trying to escape the winter scenes, as there aren�t as many snow showers blowing that far across the UK. However, that looks like it will change tomorrow.
An area of low pressure is heading in from the east, bringing heavy snow for many eastern parts of England at first, but that will spread through the rest of England and Wales through the day. For Wales and the southwest, areas which have remained fairly unaffected by the recent day�s snow, a real change is on the way. If there�s one day a week that you ought to stay home then Thursday is it.
As much as 15cm of snow could fall across some eastern hills by tomorrow, but generally most eastern areas could expect three to five cm by the morning.
As the day goes on, so the conditions will worsen. Heavy snow, accompanied by strong to gale force winds across northeast England, will result in blizzard conditions for some. The vastly reduced visibility will make driving conditions very dangerous, so the advice is not to travel unless it is absolutely necessary.
But it isn�t just the snow that�s causing problems. Ice is a serious hazard at the moment, especially over the western areas where the snow showers have been infrequent. Northern Ireland and western Scotland are likely to see a clear night tonight, and so temperatures overnight will plummet � perhaps with lows of minus ten Celsius over the Scottish glens � roads are likely to be exceptionally treacherous for the next 24 hours.
Keep up to date with the forecasts over the next day or so to make sure you have all the latest details. You can use the website here, or perhaps take a look at the interactive weather on BBCi by pressing the red button.
