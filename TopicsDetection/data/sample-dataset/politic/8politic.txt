Lobbying group Christian Concern has accused Stonewall of trying to shut down legitimate debate about the introduction of gay marriage.

Stonewall Scotland director Colin Macfarlane said: "As Britain's first openly gay leader of a mainstream political party, Ruth has shown thousands of young gay Scots that they can aspire to be what they want to be."

He added: "It's fitting that Stonewall's 10,000 supporters voted decisively to name Cardinal O'Brien as Bigot of the Year.

"We've never called anyone a bigot just because they don't agree with us, but in just the past 12 months the cardinal has gone well beyond what any normal person would call a decent level of public discourse."

A spokesman for the Catholic Church said: "Stonewall's decision to award their Bigot of the Year award to Cardinal O'Brien reveals the depth of their intolerance and their willingness to attack and demean those who don't share their views.

"Stonewall and others have promoted terms like bigot and homophobe relentlessly, in order to intimidate and vilify anyone who dares oppose their agenda. It is an agenda which the wider public does not endorse and which their excessive language has undermined."

Christian Concern's Andrea Minichiello Williams said she regarded Cardinal Keith O'Brien as "a courageous Christian leader who has stood for the truth".

"Neither he nor any faithful Christian is homophobic. Stonewall's attack on him reveals their contempt and brazen attitude to this who will not capitulate to their agenda."
