Text: Brington church - original burial site


Great Brington is the nearest village to Althorp Park. It is a village of 200 with a post office and a pub but no public toilets or coach parking and seems ill prepared to host either the immediate media invasion or the flood of tourists certain to arrive for years to come.
The village's name means 'town on the brink', because of its location on a 400ft hill.  After the nearby ceremony, locals fear that is literally what it will become. 

Locals fear the intensity of interest could overwhelm Great Brington.  Another villager said: It will be like Elvis's grave.  Everybody will want to come here just to pay their respects.
Althorp House is already open 60 days a year and costs �5 a person to visit.  After inheriting the home after his father's death, Earl Spencer said his stepmother had spent �2 million converting it into something like a five-star hotel in Monaco.  In a bid to stop yearly losses of �450,000, he opened the house's doors to business two years ago and hires it out for corporate entertainment.

Haunted House
Diana moved to Althorp House in 1976.  She was said to love the grounds and house, which was bought by Sir John Spencer in 1508 - despite rumours of ghosts haunting its many corridors, halls and rooms. 
In one story, Jack, the seventh Earl of Spencer, appeared a year after his death when his son, Johnny, married Diana's stepmother in 1976.  A family member who died as an infant is also said to haunt the picture gallery. 
A former Althorp cook, 76-year-old Betty Andrews, said Diana's time in the house remained with her throughout her later days as a royal.  Looking back, it was probably the happiest time of her life, she said.  You get the sense that she is coming home.  Her father is buried here.  I'm sure it is what she would have wanted. 
The house itself was extended into a large mansion in 1790.  Over the course of time, the Spencer family collected one of Europe's finest private collections of paintings and china - although many of these valuable items have been sold off in the past two decades in order to pay for the high running costs of the house.

Spencer Family History
Even before her marriage to Prince Charles, Lady Diana Spencer was hardly a commoner.  Genealogists calculated she was her husband's seventh cousin once removed and traced her bloodline to George Washington, Humphrey Bogart, Bonnie Prince Charlie and Rudolfo Valentino. 
Diana had five lines of descent, mostly through illegitimate children, from King Charles the Second, who reigned in the seventeenth century.  This pedigree linked her to the Stuart dynasty, which, because of its Roman Catholic faith, lost the throne to the Protestant Hanoverians, the family of her former husband, Prince Charles. 
Among the princess's Spencer ancestors were the Second Earl in the consecutive historical line, George John Spencer, who served in the British navy in the early nineteenth century, and the fifth Earl Spencer, who was Viceroy of Ireland under Queen Victoria.
